# Contacts
## A CRUD CLI contacts app written in Haskell
----
Hello there! This is a CRUD CLI contacts application, written totally in Haskell. I'm making this as part of learning Haskell, so I can gain an understanding of how functors, applicatives, and monads can be used in a practical application.

I also really like Haskell, and I find the language itself to be fun and pleasant to work with.
